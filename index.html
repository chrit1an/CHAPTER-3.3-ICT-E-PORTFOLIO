<td align="center"> I've relfected heavily on myself that after seeing my periodical scores it really is different from before. It is unilike any other topic or how ms. Uminga teaches the topic, I really hope that i get honors this quarter and this cubject wont affect that. I also relfected that I really need to focus on the topic thats being discussed in the front especially ICT. I really hope that i get high grades this quarter in order to continue to keep playing for the lpsci's mens volleyball team and in order for me to also reach or to achive my dream job of being an architecht.</td>
